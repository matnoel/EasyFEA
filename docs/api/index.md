# API Reference

EasyFEA is organized into several sub-modules. While the complete API remains accessible, this documentation focuses on presenting the essential concepts needed to understand and effectively use EasyFEA. More advanced details, though available in the [source code](https://github.com/matnoel/EasyFEA), are primarily intended for experienced users and developers.
