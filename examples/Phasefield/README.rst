PhaseField damage simulations for quasi-static brittle fracture
===============================================================

Scripts that demonstrate phase-field damage simulations.

To enable fast execution, these examples use coarse meshes and large loading steps.
In practice, fine meshes and smaller increments are essential to obtain realistic and accurate results.

For more realistic simulations, make sure you use a finer mesh and smaller loading steps by setting ``meshTest=False``.
